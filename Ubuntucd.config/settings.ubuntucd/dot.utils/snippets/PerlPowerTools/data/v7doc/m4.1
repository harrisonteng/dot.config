NAME
       m4 - macro processor

SYNOPSIS
       m4 [ files ]

DESCRIPTION
       M4  is  a macro processor intended as a front end for Rat-
       for, C, and other languages.  Each of the  argument  files
       is processed in order; if there are no arguments, or if an
       argument is `-', the standard input  is	read.	The  pro-
       cessed text is written on the standard output.

       Macro calls have the form

	    name(arg1,arg2, . . . , argn)

       The `(' must immediately follow the name of the macro.  If
       a defined macro name is not  followed  by  a  `(',  it  is
       deemed  to  have	 no  arguments.	 Leading unquoted blanks,
       tabs, and newlines are ignored while collecting arguments.
       Potential  macro names consist of alphabetic letters, dig-
       its, and underscore `_', where the first character is  not
       a digit.

       Left  and  right	 single	 quotes	 (`')  are  used to quote
       strings.	 The value of  a  quoted  string  is  the  string
       stripped of the quotes.

       When  a	macro  name is recognized, its arguments are col-
       lected by searching  for	 a  matching  right  parenthesis.
       Macro  evaluation  proceeds normally during the collection
       of the arguments, and  any  commas  or  right  parentheses
       which  happen to turn up within the value of a nested call
       are as effective as those  in  the  original  input  text.
       After  argument	collection,  the  value	 of  the macro is
       pushed back onto the input stream and rescanned.

       M4 makes available the following	 built-in  macros.   They
       may be redefined, but once this is done the original mean-
       ing is lost.   Their  values  are  null	unless	otherwise
       stated.

       define	 The second argument is installed as the value of
		 the macro whose  name	is  the	 first	argument.
		 Each  occurrence  of $n in the replacement text,
		 where n is a digit,  is  replaced  by	the  n-th
		 argument.   Argument 0 is the name of the macro;
		 missing  arguments  are  replaced  by	the  null
		 string.

       undefine	 removes the definition of the macro named in its
		 argument.

       ifdef	 If the first argument is defined, the	value  is
		 the  second  argument,	 otherwise the third.  If
		 there is no third argument, the value	is  null.
		 The  word unix is predefined on UNIX versions of
		 m4.

       changequote
		 Change quote characters to the first and  second
		 arguments.	Changequote   without	arguments
		 restores the original values (i.e., `').

       divert	 M4 maintains 10 output	 streams,  numbered  0-9.
		 The  final  output  is	 the concatenation of the
		 streams in numerical order; initially	stream	0
		 is the current stream.	 The divert macro changes
		 the current output stream to its  (digit-string)
		 argument.   Output  diverted  to  a stream other
		 than 0 through 9 is discarded.

       undivert	 causes immediate output of text from  diversions
		 named	as  arguments,	or  all	 diversions if no
		 argument.  Text may be undiverted  into  another
		 diversion.   Undiverting  discards  the diverted
		 text.

       divnum	 returns the value of the current output  stream.

       dnl	 reads	and discards characters up to and includ-
		 ing the next newline.

       ifelse	 has three or more arguments.  If the first argu-
		 ment  is the same string as the second, then the
		 value is the third argument.	If  not,  and  if
		 there	are more than four arguments, the process
		 is repeated with arguments 4, 5, 6 and 7.   Oth-
		 erwise,  the  value is either the fourth string,
		 or, if it is not present, null.

       incr	 returns the value of its argument incremented by
		 1.   The  value of the argument is calculated by
		 interpreting an initial digit-string as a  deci-
		 mal number.

       eval	 evaluates  its argument as an arithmetic expres-
		 sion,	using	32-bit	 arithmetic.	Operators
		 include +, -, *, /, %, ^ (exponentiation); rela-
		 tionals; parentheses.

       len	 returns the number of characters  in  its  argu-
		 ment.

       index	 returns the position in its first argument where
		 the second argument begins (zero origin), or  -1
		 if the second argument does not occur.

       substr	 returns  a substring of its first argument.  The
		 second argument is a zero origin number  select-
		 ing  the  first  character;  the  third argument
		 indicates the length of the substring.	 A  miss-
		 ing  third  argument is taken to be large enough
		 to extend to the end of the first string.

       translit	 transliterates the characters in its first argu-
		 ment  from  the set given by the second argument
		 to the set given by the third.	 No abbreviations
		 are permitted.

       include	 returns  the  contents	 of the file named in the
		 argument.

       sinclude	 is identical to include,  except  that	 it  says
		 nothing if the file is inaccessible.

       syscmd	 executes  the	UNIX  command  given in the first
		 argument.  No value is returned.

       maketemp	 fills in a string of XXXXX in its argument  with
		 the current process id.

       errprint	 prints	 its  argument	on  the diagnostic output
		 file.

       dumpdef	 prints current names and  definitions,	 for  the
		 named	items,	or  for	 all  if no arguments are
		 given.
