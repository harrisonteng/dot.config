NAME
       ls  -  list contents of directory

SYNOPSIS
       ls [ -ltasdrucifg ] name ...

DESCRIPTION
       For  each directory argument, ls lists the contents of the
       directory; for each file argument, ls repeats its name and
       any  other  information	requested.   The output is sorted
       alphabetically by default.  When no argument is given, the
       current	directory  is listed.  When several arguments are
       given, the arguments are first sorted  appropriately,  but
       file  arguments	appear	before directories and their con-
       tents.  There are several options:

       -l     List in long format, giving mode, number of  links,
	      owner, size in bytes, and time of last modification
	      for each file.  (See below.)  If the file is a spe-
	      cial  file  the size field will instead contain the
	      major and minor device numbers.

       -t     Sort by time modified (latest first) instead of  by
	      name, as is normal.

       -a     List  all	 entries; usually `.'  and `..'	 are sup-
	      pressed.

       -s     Give size in blocks, including indirect blocks, for
	      each entry.

       -d     If argument is a directory, list only its name, not
	      its contents (mostly used with -l to get status  on
	      directory).

       -r     Reverse the order of sort to get reverse alphabetic
	      or oldest first as appropriate.

       -u     Use time of last access instead of  last	modifica-
	      tion for sorting (-t) or printing (-l).

       -c     Use time of last modification to inode (mode, etc.)
	      instead of last modification to  file  for  sorting
	      (-t) or printing (-l).

       -i     Print  i-number  in  first column of the report for
	      each file listed.

       -f     Force each argument to be interpreted as	a  direc-
	      tory  and	 list  the name found in each slot.  This
	      option turns off -l, -t, -s, and -r, and	turns  on
	      -a;  the order is the order in which entries appear
	      in the directory.

       -g     Give group ID instead of owner ID in long	 listing.

       The  mode  printed under the -l option contains 11 charac-
       ters which are interpreted as follows: the first character
       is

       d  if the entry is a directory;
       b  if the entry is a block-type special file;
       c  if the entry is a character-type special file;
       -  if the entry is a plain file.

       The  next  9  characters	 are interpreted as three sets of
       three bits each.	 The first set refers  to  owner  permis-
       sions; the next to permissions to others in the same user-
       group; and the last to all others.  Within  each	 set  the
       three characters indicate permission respectively to read,
       to write, or to execute the file	 as  a	program.   For	a
       directory,  `execute'  permission  is  interpreted to mean
       permission to search the directory for a	 specified  file.
       The permissions are indicated as follows:

       r  if the file is readable;
       w  if the file is writable;
       x  if the file is executable;
       -  if the indicated permission is not granted.

       The  group-execute  permission  character is given as s if
       the file has set-group-ID mode; likewise the  user-execute
       permission  character  is  given as s if the file has set-
       user-ID mode.

       The last character of the mode (normally `x' or `-') is	t
       if  the	1000 bit of the mode is on.  See chmod(1) for the
       meaning of this mode.

       When the sizes of the files in a directory are  listed,	a
       total  count  of	 blocks,  including  indirect  blocks  is
       printed.

FILES
       /etc/passwd to get user ID's for `ls -l'.
       /etc/group to get group ID's for `ls -g'.
