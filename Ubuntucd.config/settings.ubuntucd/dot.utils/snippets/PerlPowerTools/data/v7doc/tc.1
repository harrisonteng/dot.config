NAME
       tc - photypesetter simulator

SYNOPSIS
       tc [ -t ] [ -sN ] [ -pL ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tc interprets its input (standard input default) as device
       codes for a Graphic Systems  phototypesetter  (cat).   The
       standard	 output of tc is intended for a Tektronix 4015 (a
       4014 teminal with ASCII and APL character sets).	 The six-
       teen  typesetter	 sizes	are  mapped  into the 4014's four
       sizes; the entire TROFF character set is drawn  using  the
       4014's  character generator, using overstruck combinations
       where necessary.	 Typical usage:

		      troff -t file | tc

       At the end of each page tc  waits  for  a  newline  (empty
       line)  from  the keyboard before continuing on to the next
       page.  In this wait state, the command e will suppress the
       screen  erase before the next page; sN will cause the next
       N pages to be skipped; and !line will  send  line  to  the
       shell.

       The command line options are:

       -t     Don't wait between pages; for directing output into
	      a file.

       -sN    Skip the first N pages.

       -pL    Set page length to L.  L may include the scale fac-
	      tors p (points), i (inches), c (centimeters), and P
	      (picas); default is picas.

       '-l w' Multiply the default aspect ratio, 1.5, of  a  dis-
	      played page by l/w.

BUGS
       Font distinctions are lost.
       The aspect ratio option is unbelievable.
