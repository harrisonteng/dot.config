NAME
       ps - process status

SYNOPSIS
       ps [ aklx ] [ namelist ]

DESCRIPTION
       Ps  prints  certain indicia about active processes.  The a
       option asks for information about all processes with  ter-
       minals  (ordinarily  only  one's	 own  processes	 are dis-
       played); x asks even about processes with no  terminal;	l
       asks  for  a long listing.  The short listing contains the
       process ID, tty letter, the cumulative execution	 time  of
       the process and an approximation to the command line.

       The long listing is columnar and contains

       F      Flags  associated	 with  the process.  01: in core;
	      02: system process; 04: locked in	 core  (e.g.  for
	      physical	I/O); 10: being swapped; 20: being traced
	      by another process.

       S      The state	 of  the  process.   0:	 nonexistent;  S:
	      sleeping;	 W: waiting; R: running; I: intermediate;
	      Z: terminated; T: stopped.

       UID    The user ID of the process owner.

       PID    The process ID of the process; as in certain  cults
	      it  is  possible	to kill a process if you know its
	      true name.

       PPID   The process ID of the parent process.

       CPU    Processor utilization for scheduling.

       PRI    The priority of the process; high numbers mean  low
	      priority.

       NICE   Used in priority computation.

       ADDR   The core address of the process if resident, other-
	      wise the disk address.

       SZ     The size in blocks of the core image  of	the  pro-
	      cess.

       WCHAN  The  event  for  which  the  process  is waiting or
	      sleeping; if blank, the process is running.

       TTY    The controlling tty for the process.

       TIME   The cumulative execution time for the process.

       The command and its arguments.

       A process that has exited and has a parent,  but	 has  not
       yet been waited for by the parent is marked <defunct>.  Ps
       makes an educated guess as to the file name and	arguments
       given  when the process was created by examining core mem-
       ory or the swap area.  The method is  inherently	 somewhat
       unreliable  and	in  any	 event	a  process is entitled to
       destroy this information, so the names cannot  be  counted
       on too much.

       If  the	k  option is specified, the file /usr/sys/core is
       used in place of /dev/mem.  This is  used  for  postmortem
       system  debugging.   If	a second argument is given, it is
       taken to be the file containing the system's namelist.

FILES
       /unix	     system namelist
       /dev/mem	     core memory
       /usr/sys/core alternate core file
       /dev	     searched to find swap device and tty names

SEE ALSO
       kill(1)

BUGS
       Things can change while ps  is  running;	 the  picture  it
       gives is only a close approximation to reality.
       Some data printed for defunct processes is irrelevant
