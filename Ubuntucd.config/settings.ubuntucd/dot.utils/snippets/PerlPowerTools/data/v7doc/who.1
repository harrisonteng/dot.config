NAME
       who  -  who is on the system

SYNOPSIS
       who [ who-file ] [ am I ]

DESCRIPTION
       Who,  without  an argument, lists the login name, terminal
       name, and login time for each current UNIX user.

       Without an argument, who examines the  /etc/utmp	 file  to
       obtain  its information.	 If a file is given, that file is
       examined.  Typically the given file will be /usr/adm/wtmp,
       which  contains	a  record  of all the logins since it was
       created.	 Then who  lists  logins,  logouts,  and  crashes
       since the creation of the wtmp file.  Each login is listed
       with user name, terminal name (with  `/dev/'  suppressed),
       and  date  and  time.   When an argument is given, logouts
       produce a similar line without a user name.  Reboots  pro-
       duce  a line with `x' in the place of the device name, and
       a fossil time indicative of when the system went down.

       With two arguments, as in `who am I' (and  also	`who  are
       you'), who tells who you are logged in as.
