FACTOR(1)						FACTOR(1)

NAME
       factor, primes - factor a number, generate large primes

SYNOPSIS
       factor [ number ]

       primes

DESCRIPTION
       When factor is invoked without an argument, it waits for a
       number to be typed in.  If you type in a	 positive  number
       less than 256 (about 7.2e16) it will factor the number and
       print its prime factors; each one is  printed  the  proper
       number  of  times.   Then it waits for another number.  It
       exits if it encounters a zero or any  non-numeric  charac-
       ter.

       If factor is invoked with an argument, it factors the num-
       ber as above and then exits.

       Maximum time to factor  is  proportional	 to  sqrt(n)  and
       occurs when n is prime or the square of a prime.	 It takes
       1 minute to factor a prime near 1014 on a PDP11.

       When primes is invoked, it waits for a number to be  typed
       in.   If	 you  type  in a positive number less than 256 it
       will print all primes greater than or equal to  this  num-
       ber.

DIAGNOSTICS
       `Ouch.' for input out of range or for garbage input.
