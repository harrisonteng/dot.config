NAME
       tk - paginator for the Tektronix 4014

SYNOPSIS
       tk [ -t ] [ -N ] [ -pL ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  output  of tk is intended for a Tektronix 4014 termi-
       nal.  Tk arranges for 66	 lines	to  fit	 on  the  screen,
       divides	the  screen  into  N  columns, and contributes an
       eight space page offset	in  the	 (default)  single-column
       case.   Tabs,  spaces,  and  backspaces	are collected and
       plotted when  necessary.	  Teletype  Model  37  half-  and
       reverse-line  sequences	are  interpreted and plotted.  At
       the end of each page tk waits for a newline  (empty  line)
       from  the  keyboard before continuing on to the next page.
       In this wait state, the command	!command  will	send  the
       command to the shell.

       The command line options are:

       -t     Don't wait between pages; for directing output into
	      a file.

       -N     Divide the screen into N columns and wait after the
	      last column.

       -pL    Set page length to L lines.
