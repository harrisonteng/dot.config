NAME
       spell, spellin, spellout - find spelling errors

SYNOPSIS
       spell [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

       /usr/src/cmd/spell/spellin [ list ]

       /usr/src/cmd/spell/spellout [ -d ] list

DESCRIPTION
       Spell  collects	words from the named documents, and looks
       them up in a spelling  list.   Words  that  neither  occur
       among  nor are derivable (by applying certain inflections,
       prefixes or suffixes) from words in the spelling list  are
       printed	on  the	 standard output.  If no files are named,
       words are collected from the standard input.

       Spell ignores most troff, tbl and eqn(1) constructions.

       Under the -v  option,  all  words  not  literally  in  the
       spelling	 list are printed, and plausible derivations from
       spelling list words are indicated.

       Under the -b option, British spelling is checked.  Besides
       preferring  centre,  colour,  speciality, travelled, etc.,
       this option insists upon -ise in words  like  standardise,
       Fowler and the OED to the contrary notwithstanding.

       Under  the -x option, every plausible stem is printed with
       `=' for each word.

       The spelling list is based on many sources, and while more
       haphazard than an ordinary dictionary, is also more effec-
       tive in respect to  proper  names  and  popular	technical
       words.	Coverage of the specialized vocabularies of biol-
       ogy, medicine and chemistry is light.

       Pertinent auxiliary files may be specified by  name  argu-
       ments,	indicated  below  with	their  default	settings.
       Copies of all output are accumulated in the history  file.
       The    stop    list   filters   out   misspellings   (e.g.
       thier=thy-y+ier) that would otherwise pass.

       Two routines help maintain the hash lists used  by  spell.
       Both  expect a list of words, one per line, from the stan-
       dard input.  Spellin adds the words on the standard  input
       to the preexisting list and places a new list on the stan-
       dard output.  If no list is specified,  the  new	 list  is
       created	from scratch.  Spellout looks up each word in the
       standard input and prints on  the  standard  output  those
       that  are missing from (or present on, with option -d) the
       hash list.

BUGS
       The  spelling list's coverage is uneven; new installations
       will probably wish  to  monitor	the  output  for  several
       months to gather local additions.
       British spelling was done by an American.
