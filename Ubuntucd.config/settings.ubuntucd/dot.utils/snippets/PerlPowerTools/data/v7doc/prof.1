NAME
       prof - display profile data

SYNOPSIS
       prof [ -v ] [ -a ] [ -l ] [ -low [ -high ] ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Prof  interprets	 the file mon.out produced by the monitor
       subroutine.  Under default modes, the symbol table in  the
       named  object  file (a.out default) is read and correlated
       with the mon.out profile file.  For each external  symbol,
       the percentage of time spent executing between that symbol
       and the next is printed (in  decreasing	order),	 together
       with  the  number of times that routine was called and the
       number of milliseconds per call.

       If the -a option is used, all symbols are reported  rather
       than just external symbols.  If the -l option is used, the
       output is listed by symbol value	 rather	 than  decreasing
       percentage.

       If the -v option is used, all printing is suppressed and a
       graphic version of the profile is produced on the standard
       output  for  display  by the plot(1) filters.  The numbers
       low and high, by default 0 and 100, cause a selected  per-
       centage	of  the	 profile  to  be plotted with accordingly
       higher resolution.

       In order for the number of calls to a routine to	 be  tal-
       lied,  the  -p  option of cc must have been given when the
       file containing the routine  was	 compiled.   This  option
       also arranges for the mon.out file to be produced automat-
       ically.
