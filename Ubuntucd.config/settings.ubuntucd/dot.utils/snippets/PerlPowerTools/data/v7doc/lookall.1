NAME
       lookall - look through all text files on UNIX

SYNOPSIS
       lookall [ -Cn ]

DESCRIPTION
       Lookall accepts keywords from the standard input, performs
       a search similar to  that  of  refer(1),	 and  writes  the
       result on the standard output.  Lookall consults, however,
       an index to all the text files on the system  rather  than
       just bibliographies.  Only the first 50 words of each file
       (roughly) were used to make the indexes.	 Blank lines  are
       taken as delimiters between queries.

       The  -Cn	 option specifies a coordination level search: up
       to n keywords may be missing from  the  answers,	 and  the
       answers are listed with those containing the most keywords
       first.

       The command sequence in /usr/dict/lookall/makindex  regen-
       erates the index.

FILES
       The  directory /usr/dict/lookall contains the index files.

DIAGNOSTICS
       `Warning: index precedes file ...'  means that a file  has
       been  changed  since  the  index	 was  made  and it may be
       retrieved (or not retrieved) erroneously.

BUGS
       Coordination level searching doesn't  work  as  described:
       only  those  acceptable	items with the smallest number of
       missing keywords are retreived.
