NAME
       wump - the game of hunt-the-wumpus

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/games/wump

DESCRIPTION
       Wump  plays  the game of `Hunt the Wumpus.'  A Wumpus is a
       creature that lives in a cave with several rooms connected
       by  tunnels.   You wander among the rooms, trying to shoot
       the Wumpus with an arrow, meanwhile avoiding  being  eaten
       by the Wumpus and falling into Bottomless Pits.	There are
       also Super Bats which are likely to pick you up	and  drop
       you in some random room.

       The  program  asks  various questions which you answer one
       per line; it will give a more detailed description if  you
       want.

       This  program  is  based on one described in People's Com-
       puter Company, 2, 2 (November 1973).

BUGS
       It will never replace Space War.
