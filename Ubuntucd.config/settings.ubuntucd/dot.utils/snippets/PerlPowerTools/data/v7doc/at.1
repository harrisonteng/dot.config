NAME
       at - execute commands at a later time

SYNOPSIS
       at time [ day ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       At squirrels away a copy of the named file (standard input
       default) to be used as input to sh(1) at a specified later
       time.   A  cd(1)	 command  to  the  current  directory  is
       inserted at the beginning, followed by assignments to  all
       environment  variables.	 When  the script is run, it uses
       the user and group ID of the creator of the copy file.

       The time is 1 to 4 digits, with an optional following `A',
       `P', `N' or `M' for AM, PM, noon or midnight.  One and two
       digit numbers are taken to be hours, three and four digits
       to be hours and minutes.	 If no letters follow the digits,
       a 24 hour clock time is understood.

       The optional day is either (1) a month name followed by	a
       day  number,  or (2) a day of the week; if the word `week'
       follows invocation is moved seven days further off.  Names
       of  months  and days may be recognizably truncated.  Exam-
       ples of legitimate commands are

	      at 8am jan 24
	      at 1530 fr week

       At programs are executed by periodic execution of the com-
       mand  /usr/lib/atrun  from cron(8).  The granularity of at
       depends upon how often atrun is executed.

       Standard output or error output is lost unless redirected.

BUGS
       Due to the granularity of the execution of /usr/lib/atrun,
       there  may  be bugs in scheduling things almost exactly 24
       hours into the future.
