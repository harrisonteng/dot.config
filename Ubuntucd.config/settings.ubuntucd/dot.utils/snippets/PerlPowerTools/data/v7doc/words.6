NAME
       hangman, words - word games

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/games/hangman [ dict ]

       /usr/games/words

DESCRIPTION
       Hangman	chooses a word at least seven letters long from a
       word list.  The user is to guess letters one at a time.

       The optional argument names an alternate word  list.   The
       special	name `-a' gets a particular very large word list.

       Words prints all the uncapitalized words in the word  list
       that can be made from letters in string.

FILES
       /usr/dict/words		the regular word list
       /crp/dict/web2	   the the -a word list

DIAGNOSTICS
       After  each  round,  hangman reports the average number of
       guesses per round and the number of rounds.

BUGS
       Hyphenated compounds are run together.

       UNIX software is distributed without the -a word list.
