NAME
       refer,  lookbib - find and insert literature references in
       documents

SYNOPSIS
       refer [ option ] ...

       lookbib [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Lookbib accepts	keywords  from	the  standard  input  and
       searches	 a  bibliographic  data	 base for references that
       contain those keywords anywhere in title, author,  journal
       name,  etc.   Matching references are printed on the stan-
       dard output.  Blank lines are taken as delimiters  between
       queries.

       Refer  is  a preprocessor for nroff or troff(1) that finds
       and formats references.	The input files	 (standard  input
       default)	 are  copied  to  the standard output, except for
       lines between .[ and .]	command lines, which are  assumed
       to  contain  keywords  as for lookbib, and are replaced by
       information from the bibliographic data	base.	The  user
       may  avoid the search, override fields from it, or add new
       fields.	The reference data,  from  whatever  source,  are
       assigned	 to  a set of troff strings.  Macro packages such
       as ms(7) print the  finished  reference	text  from  these
       strings.	  A  flag  is  placed in the text at the point of
       reference; by default the references are indicated by num-
       bers.

       The following options are available:

       -ar   Reverse  the  first  r  author  names  (Jones, J. A.
	     instead of J. A. Jones).  If r is omitted all author
	     names are reversed.

       -b    Bare  mode:  do  not  put any flags in text (neither
	     numbers nor labels).

       -cstring
	     Capitalize (with CAPS SMALL CAPS) the  fields  whose
	     key-letters are in string.

       -e    Instead of leaving the references where encountered,
	     accumulate them until a sequence of the form
		       .[
		       $LIST$
		       .]
	     is encountered, and then write  out  all  references
	     collected	so  far.  Collapse references to the same
	     source.

       -kx   Instead  of  numbering  references,  use  labels  as

								1

REFER(1)						 REFER(1)

	     specified	in a reference data line beginning %x; by
	     default x is L.

       -lm,n Instead of numbering  references,	use  labels  made
	     from  the	senior author's last name and the year of
	     publication.  Only the first m letters of	the  last
	     name and the last n digits of the date are used.  If
	     either m or ,n is omitted the entire  name	 or  date
	     respectively is used.

       -p    Take the next argument as a file of references to be
	     searched.	The default file is searched last.

       -n    Do not search the default file.

       -skeys
	     Sort references by fields whose key-letters  are  in
	     the  keys	string; permute reference numbers in text
	     accordingly.  Implies -e.	The key-letters	 in  keys
	     may  be  followed	by  a number to indicate how many
	     such fields are used, with + taken as a  very  large
	     number.  The default is AD which sorts on the senior
	     author and then date; to sort, for example,  on  all
	     authors and then title use -sA+T.

       To  use	your  own  references,	put  them  in  the format
       described in pubindex(1) They can be searched more rapidly
       by running pubindex(1) on them before using refer; failure
       to index results in a linear search.

       When refer is used with eqn, neqn or tbl, refer should  be
       first,  to  minimize  the  volume  of  data passed through
       pipes.
