NAME
       time - time a command

SYNOPSIS
       time command

DESCRIPTION
       The  given command is executed; after it is complete, time
       prints the elapsed time during the command, the time spent
       in the system, and the time spent in execution of the com-
       mand.  Times are reported in seconds.

       The execution time can depend on what kind of  memory  the
       program	happens to land in; the user time in MOS is often
       half what it is in core.

       The times are printed on the diagnostic output stream.

BUGS
       Elapsed time is accurate to  the	 second,  while	 the  CPU
       times  are  measured  to the 60th second.  Thus the sum of
       the CPU times can be  up	 to  a	second	larger	than  the
       elapsed time.
