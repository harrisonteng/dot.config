NAME
       intro - introduction to commands

DESCRIPTION
       This  section  describes	 publicly  accessible commands in
       alphabetic order.  Certain  distinctions	 of  purpose  are
       made in the headings:

       (1)    Commands of general utility.

       (1C)   Commands for communication with other systems.

       (1G)   Commands	used primarily for graphics and computer-
	      aided design.

       (1M)   Commands used primarily for system maintenance.

       The word `local' at the foot of a page means that the com-
       mand is not intended for general distribution.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Upon termination each command returns two bytes of status,
       one supplied by the system giving the cause  for	 termina-
       tion,  and  (in the case of `normal' termination) one sup-
       plied by the program, see wait and  exit(2).   The  former
       byte  is 0 for normal termination, the latter is customar-
       ily 0 for successful execution, nonzero to indicate  trou-
       bles  such  as  erroneous  parameters, bad or inaccessible
       data, or other inability to cope with the  task	at  hand.
       It  is  called  variously  `exit	 code',	 `exit status' or
       `return code', and is described only where special conven-
       tions are involved.
