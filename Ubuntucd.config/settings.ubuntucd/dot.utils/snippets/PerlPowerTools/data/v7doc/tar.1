NAME
       tar  -  tape archiver

SYNOPSIS
       tar [ key ] [ name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tar  saves and restores files on magtape.  Its actions are
       controlled by the key argument.	The key is  a  string  of
       characters containing at most one function letter and pos-
       sibly one or more function modifiers.  Other arguments  to
       the  command  are file or directory names specifying which
       files are to be dumped or restored.  In all cases, appear-
       ance  of	 a directory name refers to the files and (recur-
       sively) subdirectories of that directory.

       The function portion of the key is specified by one of the
       following letters:

       r       The  named  files  are  written	on the end of the
	       tape.  The c function implies this.

       x       The named files are extracted from the  tape.   If
	       the  named file matches a directory whose contents
	       had been written onto the tape, this directory  is
	       (recursively)  extracted.  The owner, modification
	       time, and mode are restored (if possible).  If  no
	       file  argument is given, the entire content of the
	       tape is extracted.  Note that if multiple  entries
	       specifying the same file are on the tape, the last
	       one overwrites all earlier.

       t       The names of the specified files are  listed  each
	       time  they occur on the tape.  If no file argument
	       is given, all of the names on the tape are listed.

       u       The  named  files  are added to the tape if either
	       they are not already there or have  been	 modified
	       since last put on the tape.

       c       Create a new tape; writing begins on the beginning
	       of the tape instead of after the last file.   This
	       command implies r.

       The  following  characters  may be used in addition to the
       letter which selects the function desired.

       0,...,7	 This modifier selects the  drive  on  which  the
		 tape is mounted.  The default is 1.

       v	 Normally  tar	does  its  work	 silently.  The v
		 (verbose) option causes it to type the	 name  of
		 each  file  it	 treats	 preceded by the function
		 letter.  With	the  t	function,  v  gives  more

		 information about the tape entries than just the
		 name.

       w	 causes tar to print the action to be taken  fol-
		 lowed by file name, then wait for user confirma-
		 tion. If a word beginning with `y' is given, the
		 action is performed. Any other input means don't
		 do it.

       f	 causes tar to use the next argument as the  name
		 of the archive instead of /dev/mt?.  If the name
		 of the file is `-', tar writes to standard  out-
		 put  or  reads from standard input, whichever is
		 appropriate. Thus, tar can be used as	the  head
		 or  tail  of a filter chain Tar can also be used
		 to move hierarchies with the command
		  cd fromdir; tar cf - . | (cd todir; tar xf -)

       b	 causes tar to	use  the  next	argument  as  the
		 blocking factor for tape records. The default is
		 1, the maximum is 20. This option should only be
		 used  with  raw  magnetic  tape  archives (See f
		 above).  The block size is determined	automati-
		 cally	when  reading  tapes (key letters `x' and
		 `t').

       l	 tells tar to complain if it cannot  resolve  all
		 of the links to the files dumped. If this is not
		 specified, no error messages are printed.

       m	 tells tar to not restore the modification times.
		 The mod time will be the time of extraction.

FILES
       /dev/mt?
       /tmp/tar*

DIAGNOSTICS
       Complaints  about  bad  key characters and tape read/write
       errors.
       Complaints if enough memory is not available to	hold  the
       link tables.

BUGS
       There  is no way to ask for the n-th occurrence of a file.
       Tape errors are handled ungracefully.
       The u option can be slow.
       The b option should not be used	with  archives	that  are
       going  to  be  updated.	The current magtape driver cannot
       backspace raw magtape.  If the archive is on a  disk  file
       the  b  option  should  not be used at all, as updating an
       archive stored in this manner can destroy it.
       The current limit on file name length is 100 characters.
