NAME
       rm, rmdir  - remove (unlink) files

SYNOPSIS
       rm [ -fri ] file ...

       rmdir dir ...

DESCRIPTION
       Rm removes the entries for one or more files from a direc-
       tory.  If an entry was the last link to the file, the file
       is destroyed.  Removal of a file requires write permission
       in its directory, but neither read nor write permission on
       the file itself.

       If  a  file has no write permission and the standard input
       is a terminal, its permissions are printed and a	 line  is
       read  from  the	standard input.	 If that line begins with
       `y' the file is deleted, otherwise the file  remains.   No
       questions are asked when the -f (force) option is given.

       If  a  designated file is a directory, an error comment is
       printed unless the optional argument -r has been used.  In
       that  case,  rm recursively deletes the entire contents of
       the specified directory, and the directory itself.

       If the -i (interactive)	option	is  in	effect,	 rm  asks
       whether	to  delete  each  file, and, under -r, whether to
       examine each directory.

       Rmdir removes entries for  the  named  directories,  which
       must be empty.

       unlink(2)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Generally self-explanatory.  It is forbidden to remove the
       file `..' merely to avoid the antisocial	 consequences  of
       inadvertently doing something like `rm -r .*'.
