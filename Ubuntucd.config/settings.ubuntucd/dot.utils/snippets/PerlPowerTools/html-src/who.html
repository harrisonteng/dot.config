<h2>What You Can Do to Help</h2>

  mail to <tt>ppt</tt> at <tt>perl.org</tt>. You can subscribe by

  We're also looking for people to test all of these on some of the more
  esoteric platforms that Perl runs on.  This is very important.
  Contrary to popular delusion, the programming world is a lot more
  diverse than merely Open Systems, @pple, and Micro$oft.  Let's make
  something for everyone (if we can), and put a few more ``WE MADE IT''
  feathers in Perl's cap.
