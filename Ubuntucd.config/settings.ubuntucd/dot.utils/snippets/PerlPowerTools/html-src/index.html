<p><big><em>The legacy continues!</em></big></p>

<p>
  Welcome to the Unix Reconstruction Project.  Our goal is quite simply
  to reimplement the classic Unix command set in pure Perl, and to have
  as much fun as we can doing so.

<h2>Download Information</h2>

<p>
  You can download the huge <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/ppt">current tree</a>
  in standard gzipped tar format, but be warned: it's large right
  now, because it contains a lot of documentation, datafiles, and extra
  bits. You can also look at individual commands in <a href="what.html">list</a>
  or <a href="doneness.html">table</a> format.

  Note: This has nothing to do with a Microsoft product that makes files
  whose names end in <TT>".ppt"</TT>.  Please don't send me any more
  mail about it. :-)  For a way to make slides using Perl rather than
  proprietary products, read the
  <a href="http://language.perl.com/misc/perlpoint.notice">notice</a> or
  download the
  <a href="http://language.perl.com/misc/perlpoint.tar.gz">kit</a>. This
  simple system uses pod to make slides, and from that create html,
  troff, and postscript.  It is not part of Perl Power Tools,
  Powerpoint, or anything else. :-)  It's also rather rough.
