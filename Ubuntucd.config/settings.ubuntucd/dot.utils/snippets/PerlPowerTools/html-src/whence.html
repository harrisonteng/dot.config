<h2>Provenance and Philosophy</h2>

<p>
  The list above derives mostly from the BSD utility set, which is our
  target emulation distribution.  Each page references the BSD manpage
  as a baseline, and when applicable, the original
  <a href="v7/index.html">Version 7</a> documentation for the command as
  well. The BSD manpages mention conformance with
  <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/pubs/catalog/t912.htm">POSIX.2</a>,
  which is nice, since the books are so expensive to buy.

  We are intentionally avoiding the anti-Unix feature bloat painfully
  demonstrated in some of the more egregious GNU (f:-)utilities or in
  the distressing System V corruptions that have infected Unix releases
  like Solaris.  For a proper attitude adjustment, you should probably
  read <a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/~rob/">Rob Pike</a>'s paper
  ``UNIX Style, or <em>cat -v</em> Considered Harmful'' from
  <strong>USENIX Summer Conference Proceedings, 1983</strong> for more
  info on this; well, if you can find it  -- anybody got a link?  (Yes,
  I realize the irony in using BSD as a guideline, considering Rob's
  position.)

  This doesn't mean that one must eschew adding things that would be
  natural in Perl, such as perhaps a <tt>wc -p</tt> that counts
  paragraphs, or a <i>grep</i> command that handles Perl regular
  expressions. But it's better to add a new command than a bunch of ugly
  options.

<p>
  History is important.  Standards are important.  But simplicity is
  paramount. It's better to get something that works in 90% of the cases
  than not getting anything at all, or to get something that's huge and
  complicated and hard to maintain.
</p>
<p>
  Follow classic, simple behaviour.  Avoid long options.  Don't load
  modules you don't have to, but do so if it makes it more portable. Let
  unrecognized options (like <tt>'-?'</tt>) elicit usage messages. 
  Above all, keep it simple, sane, and useful!  For a more recent take
  on these principles of <strong>Simplicity</strong>,
  <strong>Clarity</strong>, and <strong>Generality</strong>, see
