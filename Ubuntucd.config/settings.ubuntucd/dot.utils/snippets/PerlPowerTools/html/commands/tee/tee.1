NAME
       tee - pipe fitting

SYNOPSIS
       tee [ -i ] [ -a ] [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Tee  transcribes the standard input to the standard output
       and makes copies in the files.  Option -i  ignores  inter-
       rupts;  option  -a causes the output to be appended to the
       files rather than overwriting them.
