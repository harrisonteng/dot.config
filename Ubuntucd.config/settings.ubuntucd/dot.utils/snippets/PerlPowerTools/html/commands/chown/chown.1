NAME
       chown, chgrp - change owner or group

SYNOPSIS
       chown owner file ...

       chgrp group file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Chown  changes the owner of the files to owner.	The owner
       may be either a decimal UID or a login name found  in  the
       password file.

       Chgrp  changes  the  group-ID  of the files to group.  The
       group may be either a decimal GID or a group name found in
       the group-ID file.

       Only the super-user can change owner or group, in order to
       simplify as yet unimplemented accounting procedures.

       /etc/group
