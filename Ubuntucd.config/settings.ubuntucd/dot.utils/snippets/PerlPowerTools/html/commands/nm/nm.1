NAME
       nm  -  print name list

SYNOPSIS
       nm [ -gnopru ] [ file ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Nm prints the name list (symbol table) of each object file
       in the argument list.  If an argument  is  an  archive,	a
       listing	for  each object file in the archive will be pro-
       duced.  If no file is given, the symbols	 in  `a.out'  are
       listed.

       Each symbol name is preceded by its value (blanks if unde-
       fined) and one of the letters U (undefined), A (absolute),
       T  (text	 segment symbol), D (data segment symbol), B (bss
       segment symbol), or C (common symbol).  If the  symbol  is
       local  (non-external)  the  type	 letter is in lower case.
       The output is sorted alphabetically.

       Options are:

       -g     Print only global (external) symbols.

       -n     Sort numerically rather than alphabetically.

       -o     Prepend file or archive element name to each output
	      line rather than only once.

       -p     Don't sort; print in symbol-table order.

       -r     Sort in reverse order.

       -u     Print only undefined symbols.
