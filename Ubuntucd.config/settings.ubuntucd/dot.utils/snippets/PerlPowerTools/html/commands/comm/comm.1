NAME
       comm - select or reject lines common to two sorted files

SYNOPSIS
       comm [ - [ 123 ] ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       Comm  reads  file1  and	file2, which should be ordered in
       ASCII collating sequence, and produces a three column out-
       put:  lines  only in file1; lines only in file2; and lines
       in both files.  The filename `-' means the standard input.

       Flags  1,  2,  or 3 suppress printing of the corresponding
       column.	Thus comm -12 prints only the lines common to the
       two  files;  comm  -23 prints only lines in the first file
       but not in the second; comm -123 is a no-op.
