NAME
       pr  -  print file

SYNOPSIS
       pr [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Pr  produces  a printed listing of one or more files.  The
       output is separated into pages headed by a date, the  name
       of  the	file  or a specified header, and the page number.
       If there are no file arguments,	pr  prints  its	 standard
       input.

       Options	apply  to  all	following  files but may be reset
       between files:

       -n     Produce n-column output.

       +n     Begin printing with page n.

       -h     Take the next argument as a page header.

       -wn    For purposes of multi-column output, take the width
	      of  the  page  to	 be  n	characters instead of the
	      default 72.

       -ln    Take the length of the page to be n  lines  instead
	      of the default 66.

       -t     Do  not  print  the  5-line  header  or  the 5-line
	      trailer normally supplied for each page.

       -sc    Separate columns by the single character c  instead
	      of  by  the  appropriate	amount of white space.	A
	      missing c is taken to be a tab.

       -m     Print all files simultaneously, each in one column,

       Inter-terminal  messages via write(1) are forbidden during
       a pr.
