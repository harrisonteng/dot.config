       file - determine file type

SYNOPSIS
       file file ...

DESCRIPTION
       File  performs  a  series  of tests on each argument in an
       attempt to classify it.	If  an	argument  appears  to  be
       ascii,  file  examines  the  first  512 bytes and tries to
       guess its language.

BUGS
       It often makes mistakes.	 In particular it often	 suggests
       that command files are C programs.
