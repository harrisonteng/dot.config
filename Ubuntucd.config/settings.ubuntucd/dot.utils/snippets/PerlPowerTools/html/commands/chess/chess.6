NAME
       chess - the game of chess

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/games/chess

DESCRIPTION
       Chess  is  a  computer  program	that plays class D chess.
       Moves may be given either in standard (descriptive)  nota-
       tion  or in algebraic notation.	The symbol `+' is used to
       specify check; `o-o' and	 `o-o-o'  specify  castling.   To
       play  black,  type  `first';  to	 print the board, type an
       empty line.

       Each move is echoed in the appropriate  notation	 followed
       by the program's reply.

FILES
       /usr/lib/book	   opening `book'

DIAGNOSTICS
       The  most cryptic diagnostic is `eh?' which means that the
       input was syntactically incorrect.

WARNING
       Over-use of this program will cause it to go away.

BUGS
       Pawns may be promoted only to queens.
