NAME
       ar - archive and library maintainer

SYNOPSIS
       ar key [ posname ] afile name ...

DESCRIPTION
       Ar  maintains  groups  of  files	 combined  into	 a single
       archive file.  Its  main	 use  is  to  create  and  update
       library	files  as  used	 by  the loader.  It can be used,
       though, for any similar purpose.

       Key is one character from the set drqtpmx, optionally con-
       catenated  with	one  or	 more  of  vuaibcl.  Afile is the
       archive file.  The names	 are  constituent  files  in  the
       archive file.  The meanings of the key characters are:

       d      Delete the named files from the archive file.

       r      Replace  the  named  files in the archive file.  If
	      the optional character u is used with r, then  only
	      those  files  with  modified  dates  later than the
	      archive files are replaced.  If an  optional  posi-
	      tioning  character  from	the set abi is used, then
	      the posname argument must be present and	specifies
	      that new files are to be placed after (a) or before
	      (b or i) posname.	 Otherwise new files  are  placed
	      at the end.

       q      Quickly  append  the  named files to the end of the
	      archive file.  Optional positioning characters  are
	      invalid.	 The  command  does not check whether the
	      added members are already in the	archive.   Useful
	      only  to	avoid  quadratic behavior when creating a
	      large archive piece-by-piece.

       t      Print a table of contents of the archive file.   If
	      no  names	 are  given, all files in the archive are
	      tabled.  If names are given, only those  files  are
	      tabled.

       p      Print the named files in the archive.

       m      Move the named files to the end of the archive.  If
	      a positioning character is present, then	the  pos-
	      name  argument must be present and, as in r, speci-
	      fies where the files are to be moved.

       x      Extract the named files.	If no  names  are  given,
	      all files in the archive are extracted.  In neither
	      case does x alter the archive file.

       v      Verbose.	Under the  verbose  option,  ar	 gives	a
	      file-by-file  description	 of  the  making of a new

	      archive file from the  old  archive  and	the  con-
	      stituent	files.	When used with t, it gives a long
	      listing of all information about the  files.   When
	      used with p, it precedes each file with a name.

       c      Create.	Normally  ar  will  create  afile when it
	      needs to.	 The create option suppresses the  normal
	      message that is produced when afile is created.

       l      Local.   Normally	 ar places its temporary files in
	      the directory /tmp.  This option causes them to  be
	      placed in the local directory.

FILES
       /tmp/v*	 temporaries

BUGS
       If  the	same file is mentioned twice in an argument list,
       it may be put in the archive twice.
