NAME
       look - find lines in a sorted list

SYNOPSIS
       look [ -df ] string [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Look  consults  a  sorted  file	and prints all lines that
       begin with string.  It uses binary search.

       The options d and f affect comparisons as in sort(1):

       d   `Dictionary' order: only  letters,  digits,	tabs  and
	   blanks participate in comparisons.

       f   Fold.  Upper case letters compare equal to lower case.

       If no file is specified, /usr/dict/words is  assumed  with
       collating sequence -df.
