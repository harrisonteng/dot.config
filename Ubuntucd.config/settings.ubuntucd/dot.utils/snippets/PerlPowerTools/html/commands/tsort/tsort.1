NAME
       tsort - topological sort

SYNOPSIS
       tsort [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tsort  produces	on  the standard output a totally ordered
       list of items consistent with a partial ordering of  items
       mentioned in the input file.  If no file is specified, the
       standard input is understood.

       The input consists of pairs of  items  (nonempty	 strings)
       separated  by  blanks.	Pairs of different items indicate
       ordering.  Pairs of identical items indicate presence, but
       not ordering.

SEE ALSO
       lorder(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Odd  data:  there  is an odd number of fields in the input
       file.

BUGS
       Uses a quadratic algorithm; not worth fixing for the typi-
       cal use of ordering a library archive file.
