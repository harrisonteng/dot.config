NAME
       su  -  substitute user id temporarily

SYNOPSIS
       su [ userid ]

DESCRIPTION
       Su demands the password of the specified userid, and if it
       is given, changes to that userid	 and  invokes  the  Shell
       sh(1)  without  changing the current directory or the user
       environment (see environ(5)).  The new user  ID	stays  in
       force until the Shell exits.

       If  no  userid is specified, `root' is assumed.	To remind
       the super-user of his responsibilities, the Shell  substi-
       tutes `#' for its usual prompt.
