NAME
       arithmetic - provide drill in number facts

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/games/arithmetic [ +-x/ ] [ range ]

DESCRIPTION
       Arithmetic types out simple arithmetic problems, and waits
       for an answer to be typed in.  If the answer  is	 correct,
       it  types back "Right!", and a new problem.  If the answer
       is wrong,  it  replies  "What?",	 and  waits  for  another
       answer.	Every twenty problems, it publishes statistics on
       correctness and the time required to answer.

       To quit the program, type an interrupt (delete).

       The first optional argument determines the kind of problem
       to  be  generated;  +-x/ respectively cause addition, sub-
       traction, multiplication, and division problems to be gen-
       erated.	One or more characters can be given; if more than
       one is given, the different  types  of  problems	 will  be
       mixed in random order; default is +-

       Range  is a decimal number; all addends, subtrahends, dif-
       ferences, multiplicands, divisors, and quotients	 will  be
       less  than  or equal to the value of range.  Default range
       is 10.

       At the start, all numbers less than or equal to range  are
       equally	likely to appear.  If the respondent makes a mis-
       take, the numbers in the problem which was  missed  become
       more likely to reappear.

       As  a  matter  of educational philosophy, the program will
       not give correct answers, since	the  learner  should,  in
       principle, be able to calculate them.  Thus the program is
       intended to provide drill for someone just past the  first
       learning	 stage,	 not  to teach number facts de novo.  For
       almost all users, the relevant statistic	 should	 be  time
       per problem, not percent correct.
