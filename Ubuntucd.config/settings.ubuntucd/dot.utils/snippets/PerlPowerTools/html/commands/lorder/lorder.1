NAME
       lorder - find ordering relation for an object library

SYNOPSIS
       lorder file ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  input  is  one or more object or library archive (see
       ar(1)) files.  The standard output is a list of	pairs  of
       object file names, meaning that the first file of the pair
       refers to external identifiers defined in the second.  The
       output may be processed by tsort(1) to find an ordering of
       a library suitable for one-pass access by ld(1).

       This brash one-liner intends to build a new  library  from
       existing `.o' files.

	      ar cr library `lorder *.o | tsort`

FILES
       *symref, *symdef
       nm(1), sed(1), sort(1), join(1)

SEE ALSO
       tsort(1), ld(1), ar(1)

BUGS
       The  names  of object files, in and out of libraries, must
       end with `.o'; nonsense results otherwise.
