NAME
       echo - echo arguments

SYNOPSIS
       echo [ -n ] [ arg ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Echo  writes  its arguments separated by blanks and termi-
       nated by a newline on the standard output.  If the flag -n
       is used, no newline is added to the output.

       Echo is useful for producing diagnostics in shell programs
       and for writing constant data on pipes.	To send	 diagnos-
       tics to the standard error file, do `echo ... 1>&2'.
