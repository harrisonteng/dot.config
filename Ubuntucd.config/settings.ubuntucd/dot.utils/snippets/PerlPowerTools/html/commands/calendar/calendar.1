NAME
       calendar - reminder service

SYNOPSIS
       calendar [ - ]

DESCRIPTION
       Calendar	 consults  the	file  `calendar'  in  the current
       directory and prints out lines  that  contain  today's  or
       tomorrow's  date	 anywhere  in  the line.  Most reasonable
       month-day dates such as `Dec. 7,'  `december  7,'  `12/7,'
       etc.,  are recognized, but not `7 December' or `7/12'.  On
       weekends `tomorrow' extends through Monday.

       When an argument is present, calendar  does  its	 job  for
       every  user  who has a file `calendar' in his login direc-
       tory and sends him any positive results by mail(1).   Nor-
       mally this is done daily in the wee hours under control of
       cron(8).

FILES
       calendar
       /usr/lib/calendar to figure  out	 today's  and  tomorrow's
       dates
       /etc/passwd
       /tmp/cal*
       egrep, sed, mail subprocesses

SEE ALSO
       at(1), cron(8), mail(1)

BUGS
       Your  calendar  must  be public information for you to get
       reminder service.
       Calendar's extended idea of `tomorrow' doesn't account for
       holidays.
