NAME
       as - assembler

SYNOPSIS
       as [ - ] [ -o objfile ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       As assembles the concatenation of the named files.  If the
       optional first argument - is used, all  undefined  symbols
       in the assembly are treated as global.

       The output of the assembly is left on the file objfile; if
       that is omitted, a.out is used.	It is  executable  if  no
       errors  occurred during the assembly, and if there were no
       unresolved external references.

FILES
       /lib/as2	      pass 2 of the assembler
       /tmp/atm[1-3]? temporary
       a.out	      object

DIAGNOSTICS
       When an input file cannot be read, its name followed by	a
       question	 mark is typed and assembly ceases.  When syntac-
       tic or semantic errors occur, a single-character	 diagnos-
       tic  is	typed  out  together with the line number and the
       file name in which it occurred.	Errors in  pass	 1  cause
       cancellation of pass 2.	The possible errors are:

       )  Parentheses error
       ]  Parentheses error
       <  String not terminated properly
       *  Indirection used illegally
       a  Error in address
       b  Branch instruction is odd or too remote
       e  Error in expression
       f  Error in local (`f' or `b') type symbol
       g  Garbage (unknown) character
       i  End of file inside an if
       m  Multiply defined symbol as label
       o  Word quantity assembled at odd address
       p  `.' different in pass 1 and 2
       r  Relocation error
       u  Undefined symbol
       x  Syntax error

BUGS
       Syntax  errors can cause incorrect line numbers in follow-
       ing diagnostics.
