NAME
       mv  -  move or rename files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       mv file1 file2

       mv file ... directory

DESCRIPTION
       Mv moves (changes the name of) file1 to file2.

       If  file2  already  exists,  it is removed before file1 is
       moved.  If file2 has a  mode  which  forbids  writing,  mv
       prints  the  mode  (see	chmod(2))  and reads the standard
       input to obtain a line; if the line  begins  with  y,  the
       move takes place; if not, mv exits.

       In  the	second	form,  one or more files are moved to the
       directory with their original file-names.

       Mv refuses to move a file onto itself.

SEE ALSO
       cp(1), chmod(2)

BUGS
       If file1 and file2 lie on different file systems, mv  must
       copy  the  file and delete the original.	 In this case the
       owner name becomes that of the  copying	process	 and  any
       linking relationship with other files is lost.

       Mv  should take -f flag, like rm, to suppress the question
       if the target exists and is not writable.
