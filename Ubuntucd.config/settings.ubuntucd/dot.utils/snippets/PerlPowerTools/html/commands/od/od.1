NAME
       od  -  octal dump

SYNOPSIS
       od [ -bcdox ] [ file ] [ [ + ]offset[ . ][ b ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Od  dumps  file	in one or more formats as selected by the
       first argument.	If the first argument is missing,  -o  is
       default.	  The  meanings of the format argument characters
       are:

       b  Interpret bytes in octal.

       c  Interpret bytes in ASCII.  Certain non-graphic  charac-
	  ters	appear as C escapes: null=\0, backspace=\b, form-
	  feed=\f, newline=\n, return=\r, tab=\t;  others  appear
	  as 3-digit octal numbers.

       d  Interpret words in decimal.

       o  Interpret words in octal.

       x  Interpret words in hex.

       The  file  argument  specifies which file is to be dumped.
       If no file argument is specified, the  standard	input  is
       used.

       The offset argument specifies the offset in the file where
       dumping is to commence.	This argument is normally  inter-
       preted  as octal bytes.	If `.' is appended, the offset is
       interpreted in decimal.	If `b' is appended, the offset is
       interpreted  in blocks of 512 bytes.  If the file argument
       is omitted, the offset argument must be preceded `+'.

       Dumping continues until end-of-file.
