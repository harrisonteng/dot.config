<p>wump - Perl port of the &#34;Hunt the Wumpus&#34; game</p>

>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>Move around the tunnels and shoot the wumpus.
Don&#39;t get eaten by the wumpus,
don&#39;t fall into a pit,
don&#39;t hit yourself with an arrow,
watch out for bats.</p>

<p>The game gives more instructions.
(Embedded documentation!
Could this be a precursor to POD?)</p>

<p>Because &#34;Hunt the Wumpus&#34; is one of the classics of early BASIC coding,
I decided to stick as closely as possible to the original BASIC code.
In this way,
this program can serve not only as a fun way to while away the hours while waiting for batch jobs; but it can also be useful to teach the hordes of coders currently moving from 1970&#39;s BASIC to Perl.</p>

<p>I was mostly able to get a 1:1 correspondence between lines.
You may notice that the Perl code is a bit longer,
which I guess proves that BASIC is more powerful and concise.
The only places I cheated were to remove goto&#39;s (although I was sorely tempted to use a &#34;goto EXPR&#34; for the &#34;ON ...
GOTO&#34;s).</p>

<p>Inputs are changed into upper case for your gaming convenience.</p>

<h2><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="Miscellaneous"
>Miscellaneous</a></h2>

<p>&#34;Wumpus&#34; can be found in the Jargon File.
Some have gone so far as to say that this was the &#34;first text adventure&#34;.
In that case,
I&#39;m glad text adventures have developed since then.</p>

<h1><a class='u' href='#___top' title='click to go to top of document'
name="BUGS"
>BUGS</a></h1>

<p>I have faithfully ported the lack of a &#34;Quit&#34; option.
Also the spelling mistakes,
and any bugs in the original.
For example,
you can shoot an arrow to go through rooms &#34;1 2 2&#34;,
which shouldn&#39;t be legal.
But faithful porting means faithful porting.</p>

<p>Some web sites claim this game was originally written by Gregory Yob,
and published in Creative Computing Magazine in the September/October 1975 issue.
The OpenBSD man pages say it was &#34;People&#39;s Computer Company&#34; in 1973.
The BASIC code I used may or may not be the text that appeared in David Ahl&#39;s book &#34;101 BASIC Computer Games&#34;.</p>
