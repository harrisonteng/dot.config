WAIT(1)							  WAIT(1)

NAME
       wait - await completion of process

SYNOPSIS
       wait

DESCRIPTION
       Wait  until  all	 processes started with & have completed,
       and report on abnormal terminations.

       Because the wait(2) system call must be	executed  in  the
       parent  process,	 the  Shell itself executes wait, without
       creating a new process.

SEE ALSO
       sh(1)

BUGS
       Not all the processes of a 3- or more-stage  pipeline  are
       children of the Shell, and thus can't be waited for.
