Here's a BSD 'ar'.  Not much use without ld, but it can be used as a
poor man's tar or to read BSD archives on other machines.

It uses the POSIX strftime, which is apparently bad, but I didn't see
a point of working around this unless there was a real interest in
including this in ppt.

The pod is swiped directly from the BSD man page.
