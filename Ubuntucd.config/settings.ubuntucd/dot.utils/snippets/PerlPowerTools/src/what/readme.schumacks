Hello,
Attached is a Perl implementation of the what command.
Please add it to the PPT.

I'm just about done with the mv command (works in UNIX
land ... bit of a problem in Win98). I'll send it on
in a day or so.

best regards,
Ken
Here's an update to the what command. I wasn't
finding all @(#)'s in compiled binary files.
