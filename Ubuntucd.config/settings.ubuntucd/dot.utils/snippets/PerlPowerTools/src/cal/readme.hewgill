Greetings,

Here is an implementation of 'cal'. It could be a bit more efficient, and
it could be more perl-ish, but it should be a faithful reproduction of
cal. It handles Sep 1752 correctly, handles pre-Gregorian leap years,
and has a julian date output format.

Please let me know if you find any bugs in this implementation.
