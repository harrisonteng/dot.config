Attached is a shot at another absolutely essential Unix command:
robots.  I based the functionality on the OpenBSD version of
robots (bug-for-bug, as they say), and I tried to restrain myself
when it came to extra features.  It's numbered version 0.50, so
expect bug-fixes in the future...

      bounces from the ppt@perl.com address.
