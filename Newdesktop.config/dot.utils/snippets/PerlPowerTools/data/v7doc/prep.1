NAME
       prep - prepare text for statistical processing

SYNOPSIS
       prep [ -dio ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Prep  reads  each  file	in  sequence and writes it on the
       standard output, one `word' to a line.  A word is a string
       of  alphabetic characters and imbedded apostrophes, delim-
       ited by space or punctuation.  Hyphented words are  broken
       apart;  hyphens	at  the	 end of lines are removed and the
       hyphenated parts are joined.  Strings of digits	are  dis-
       carded.

       The following option letters may appear in any order:

       -d     Print  the  word	number (in the input stream) with
	      each word.

       -i     Take the next file  as  an  `ignore'  file.   These
	      words will not appear in the output.  (They will be
	      counted, for purposes of the -d count.)

       -o     Take the next file as an `only' file.   Only  these
	      words  will appear in the output.	 (All other words
	      will also be counted for the -d count.)

       -p     Include punctuation marks	 (single  nonalphanumeric
	      characters) as separate output lines.  The punctua-
	      tion marks are not counted for the -d count.

       Ignore and only files contain words, one per line.
