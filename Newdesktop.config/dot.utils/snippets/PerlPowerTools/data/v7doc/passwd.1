NAME
       passwd - change login password

SYNOPSIS
       passwd [ name ]

DESCRIPTION
       This  command  changes (or installs) a password associated
       with the user name (your own name by default).

       The program prompts for the old password and then for  the
       new  one.   The caller must supply both.	 The new password
       must be typed twice, to forestall mistakes.

       New passwords must be at least  four  characters	 long  if
       they  use  a  sufficiently  rich alphabet and at least six
       characters long if monocase.  These rules are  relaxed  if
       you are insistent enough.

       Only  the owner of the name or the super-user may change a
       password; the owner must prove he knows the old	password.

FILES
       /etc/passwd
