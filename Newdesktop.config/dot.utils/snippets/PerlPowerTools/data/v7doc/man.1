NAME
       man - print sections of this manual

SYNOPSIS
       man [ option ... ] [ chapter ] title ...

DESCRIPTION
       Man  locates  and  prints the section of this manual named
       title in the specified chapter.	 (In  this  context,  the
       word  `page'  is	 often used as a synonym for `section'.)
       The title is entered in lower case.   The  chapter  number
       does  not  need	a letter suffix.  If no chapter is speci-
       fied, the whole manual  is  searched  for  title	 and  all
       occurrences of it are printed.

       Options and their meanings are:

       -t     Phototypeset the section using troff(1).

       -n     Print  the  section  on  the  standard output using
	      nroff(1).

       -k     Display the output on  a	Tektronix  4014	 terminal
	      using troff(1) and tc(1).

       -e     Appended or prefixed to any of the above causes the
	      manual  section  to  be  preprocessed  by	 neqn  or
	      eqn(1); -e alone means -te.

       -w     Print the path names of the manual sections, but do
	      not print the sections themselves.

       (default)
	      Copy an already formatted	 manual	 section  to  the
	      terminal,	 or, if none is available, act as -n.  It
	      may be necessary to use a filter to adapt the  out-
	      put to the particular terminal's characteristics.

       Further	options, e.g. to specify the kind of terminal you
       have, are passed on to troff(1)	or  nroff.   Options  and
       chapter may be changed before each title.

       For example:

	      man man

       would  reproduce	 this  section, as well as any other sec-
       tions named man that may exist in other	chapters  of  the
       manual, e.g.  man(7).

BUGS
       The manual is supposed to be reproducible either on a pho-
       totypesetter or on a terminal.	However,  on  a	 terminal
       some information is necessarily lost.
