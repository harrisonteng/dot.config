NAME
       cat - catenate and print

SYNOPSIS
       cat [ -u ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Cat reads each file in sequence and writes it on the stan-
       dard output.  Thus

	      cat file

       prints the file and

	      cat file1 file2 >file3

       concatenates the first two files and places the result  on
       the third.

       If  no  file  is	 given, or if the argument `-' is encoun-
       tered, cat reads	 from  the  standard  input.   Output  is
       buffered	 in 512-byte blocks unless the standard output is
       a terminal or the -u option is present.

SEE ALSO
       pr(1), cp(1)

BUGS
       Beware of `cat a b >a' and `cat a  b  >b',  which  destroy
       input files before reading them.
