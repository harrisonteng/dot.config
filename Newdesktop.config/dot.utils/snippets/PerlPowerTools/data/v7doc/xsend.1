NAME
       xsend, xget, enroll - secret mail

SYNOPSIS
       xsend person
       xget
       enroll

DESCRIPTION
       These  commands	implement a secure communication channel;
       it is like mail(1), but	no  one	 can  read  the	 messages
       except the intended recipient.  The method embodies a pub-
       lic-key cryptosystem using knapsacks.

       To receive messages, use enroll; it asks you for	 a  pass-
       word  that you must subsequently quote in order to receive
       secret mail.

       To receive secret mail, use xget.  It asks for your  pass-
       word, then gives you the messages.

       To  send	 secret mail, use xsend in the same manner as the
       ordinary mail command.  (However, it will accept only  one
       target).	  A message announcing the receipt of secret mail
       is also sent by ordinary mail.

FILES
       /usr/spool/secretmail/*.key:    keys    /usr/spool/secret-
       mail/*.[0-9]: messages

SEE ALSO
       mail (1)

BUGS
       It should be integrated with ordinary mail.  The announce-
       ment of secret mail makes traffic analysis possible.
