NAME
       ptx - permuted index

SYNOPSIS
       ptx [ option ] ...  [ input [ output ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Ptx  generates a permuted index to file input on file out-
       put (standard input and output  default).   It  has  three
       phases:	the  first  does  the permutation, generating one
       line for each keyword in an input line.	 The  keyword  is
       rotated	to  the front.	The permuted file is then sorted.
       Finally, the sorted lines are rotated so the keyword comes
       at  the	middle	of  the page.  Ptx produces output in the
       form:

	      .xx "tail" "before  keyword"  "keyword  and  after"
	      "head"

       where  .xx  may	be  an	nroff or troff(1) macro for user-
       defined formatting.  The before keyword	and  keyword  and
       after  fields  incorporate as much of the line as will fit
       around the keyword when it is printed at the middle of the
       page.   Tail  and  head, at least one of which is an empty
       string "", are wrapped-around pieces small enough  to  fit
       in the unused space at the opposite end of the line.  When
       original text must be discarded, `/' marks the spot.

       The following options can be applied:

       -f     Fold upper and lower case letters for sorting.

       -t     Prepare the output  for  the  phototypesetter;  the
	      default line length is 100 characters.

       -w n   Use  the next argument, n, as the width of the out-
	      put line.	 The default line length  is  72  charac-
	      ters.

       -g n   Use  the next argument, n, as the number of charac-
	      ters to allow for each gap among the four parts  of
	      the  line as finally printed.  The default gap is 3
	      characters.

       -o only
	      Use as keywords only the words given  in	the  only
	      file.

       -i ignore
	      Do  not  use  as	keywords  any  words given in the
	      ignore file.  If the -i and -o options are missing,
	      use /usr/lib/eign as the ignore file.

       -b break
	      Use  the	characters  in the break file to separate
	      words.  In any case, tab, newline, and space  char-
	      acters are always used as break characters.

       -r     Take  any leading nonblank characters of each input
	      line to be a reference identifier (as to a page  or
	      chapter)	separate  from	the  text  of  the  line.
	      Attach that identifier as a 5th field on each  out-
	      put line.

       The index for this manual was generated using ptx.

BUGS
       Line length counts do not account for overstriking or pro-
       portional spacing.
