NAME
       login  -	 sign on

SYNOPSIS
       login [ username ]

DESCRIPTION
       The  login command is used when a user initially signs on,
       or it may be used at any time to change from one	 user  to
       another.	  The latter case is the one summarized above and
       described here.	See `How to Get Started' for how to  dial
       up initially.

       If  login  is  invoked  without an argument, it asks for a
       user name, and, if appropriate, a  password.   Echoing  is
       turned  off  (if	 possible) during the typing of the pass-
       word, so it will not appear on the written record  of  the
       session.

       After a successful login, accounting files are updated and
       the user is informed of the existence of	 .mail	and  mes-
       sage-of-the-day	files.	 Login	initializes  the user and
       group IDs and the working directory, then executes a  com-
       mand  interpreter  (usually sh(1)) according to specifica-
       tions found in a password file.	Argument 0 of the command
       interpreter is `-sh.

       Login  is recognized by sh(1) and executed directly (with-
       out forking).

DIAGNOSTICS
       `Login incorrect,' if the name or the password is bad.
       `No  Shell',  `cannot open password file', `no directory':
       consult a programming counselor.
