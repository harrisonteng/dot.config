NAME
       col - filter reverse line feeds

SYNOPSIS
       col [-bfx]

DESCRIPTION
       Col  reads the standard input and writes the standard out-
       put.  It performs the line  overlays  implied  by  reverse
       line  feeds  (ESC-7  in	ASCII) and by forward and reverse
       half line feeds (ESC-9 and ESC-8).   Col	 is  particularly
       useful  for  filtering  multicolumn  output  made with the
       `.rt' command of nroff and output resulting  from  use  of
       the tbl(1) preprocessor.

       Although	 col  accepts  half line motions in its input, it
       normally does not emit them on output.  Instead, text that
       would appear between lines is moved to the next lower full
       line boundary.  This treatment can be suppressed by the -f
       (fine)  option;	in this case the output from col may con-
       tain forward half line feeds (ESC-9), but will still never
       contain either kind of reverse line motion.

       If  the	-b  option  is given, col assumes that the output
       device in use is not  capable  of  backspacing.	 In  this
       case,  if  several  characters  are  to appear in the same
       place, only the last one read will be taken.

       The control characters SO (ASCII code 017), and	SI  (016)
       are  assumed to start and end text in an alternate charac-
       ter set.	 The character set (primary or alternate) associ-
       ated  with  each printing character read is remembered; on
       output, SO and SI characters are generated where necessary
       to maintain the correct treatment of each character.

       Col  normally  converts	white  space  to  tabs to shorten
       printing time.  If the -x option is given, this conversion
       is suppressed.

       All  control  characters are removed from the input except
       space, backspace, tab, return, newline, ESC (033) followed
       by  one of 789, SI, SO, and VT (013).  This last character
       is an alternate form of full reverse line feed,	for  com-
       patibility  with	 some  other  hardware	conventions.  All
       other non-printing characters are ignored.

       line.
