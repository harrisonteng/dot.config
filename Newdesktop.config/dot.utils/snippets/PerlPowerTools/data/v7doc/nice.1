NAME
       nice, nohup - run a command at low priority

SYNOPSIS
       nice [ -number ] command [ arguments ]

       nohup command [ arguments ]

DESCRIPTION
       Nice  executes  command	with low scheduling priority.  If
       the number argument is present,	the  priority  is  incre-
       mented  (higher	numbers	 mean  lower  priorities) by that
       amount up to a limit of 20.  The default number is 10.

       The super-user may run commands with priority higher  than
       normal by using a negative priority, e.g. `--10'.

       Nohup executes command immune to hangup and terminate sig-
       nals from  the  controlling  terminal.	The  priority  is
       incremented  by 5.  Nohup should be invoked from the shell
       with `&' in order to prevent it from responding to  inter-
       rupts  by  or  stealing the input from the next person who
       logs in on the same terminal.

FILES
