NAME
       newgrp - log in to a new group

SYNOPSIS
       newgrp group

DESCRIPTION
       Newgrp  changes	the  group  identification of its caller,
       analogously to login(1).	 The same person  remains  logged
       in,  and	 the current directory is unchanged, but calcula-
       tions of access permissions to files  are  performed  with
       respect to the new group ID.

       A password is demanded if the group has a password and the
       user himself does not.

       When most users log in, they  are  members  of  the  group
       named  `other.'	 Newgrp is known to the shell, which exe-
       cutes it directly without a fork.

FILES
       /etc/group, /etc/passwd
