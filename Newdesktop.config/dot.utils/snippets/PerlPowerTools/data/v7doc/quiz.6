NAME
       quiz - test your knowledge

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/games/quiz [ -i file ] [ -t ] [ category1 category2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       Quiz gives associative knowledge	 tests	on  various  sub-
       jects.	It  asks  items chosen from category1 and expects
       answers from category2.	If no categories  are  specified,
       quiz  gives  instructions  and  lists  the available cate-
       gories.

       Quiz tells a correct answer whenever you type a bare  new-
       line.   At the end of input, upon interrupt, or when ques-
       tions run out, quiz reports a score and terminates.

       The -t flag specifies `tutorial' mode, where missed  ques-
       tions are repeated later, and material is gradually intro-
       duced as you learn.

       The -i flag causes the named file to  be	 substituted  for
       the default index file.	The lines of these files have the
       syntax:

	   line	     = category newline | category `:' line
	   category  = alternate | category `|' alternate
	   alternate = empty | alternate primary
	   primary   = character | `[' category `]' | option
	   option    = `{' category `}'

       The first category on each line of an index file names  an
       information  file.   The	 remaining categories specify the
       order and contents of the data in each line of the  infor-
       mation  file.   Information  files  have	 the same syntax.
       Backslash `\' is used as with sh(1) to quote syntactically
       significant  characters	or to insert transparent newlines
       into a line.  When either a  question  or  its  answer  is
       empty, quiz will refrain from asking it.

FILES
       /usr/games/quiz.k/*

BUGS
       The  construct `a|ab' doesn't work in an information file.
       Use `a{b}'.
