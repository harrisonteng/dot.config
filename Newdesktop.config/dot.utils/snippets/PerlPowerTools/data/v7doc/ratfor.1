NAME
       ratfor - rational Fortran dialect

SYNOPSIS
       ratfor [ option ... ] [ filename ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Ratfor  converts	 a rational dialect of Fortran into ordi-
       nary irrational Fortran.	  Ratfor  provides  control  flow
       constructs essentially identical to those in C:

       statement grouping:
	      { statement; statement; statement }

       decision-making:
	      if (condition) statement [ else statement ]
	      switch (integer value) {
		   case integer:  statement
		   ...
		   [ default: ]	  statement
	      }

       loops: while (condition) statement
	      for (expression; condition; expression) statement
	      do limits statement
	      repeat statement [ until (condition) ]
	      break [n]
	      next [n]

       and some syntactic sugar to make programs easier to read and write:

       free form input:
	      multiple statements/line; automatic continuation

       comments:
	      # this is a comment

       translation of relationals:
	      >, >=, etc., become .GT., .GE., etc.

       return (expression)
	      returns expression to caller from function

       define:
	      define name replacement

       include:
	      include filename

       The  option -h causes quoted strings to be turned into 27H
       constructs.   -C	 copies	 comments  to  the  output,   and
       attempts	 to  format  it	 neatly.   Normally, continuation
       lines are marked with a & in  column  1;	 the  option  -6x
       makes the continuation character x and places it in column
