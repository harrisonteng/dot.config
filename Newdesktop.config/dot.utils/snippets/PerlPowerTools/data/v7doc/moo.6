DESCRIPTION
       Moo  is	a  guessing game imported from England.	 The com-
       puter picks a number consisting of four	distinct  decimal
       digits.	 The  player  guesses  four distinct digits being
       scored on each guess.  A `cow' is a correct  digit  in  an
       incorrect position.  A `bull' is a correct digit in a cor-
       rect  position.	 The  game  continues  until  the  player
       guesses the number (a score of four bulls).
