NAME
       ranlib - convert archives to random libraries

SYNOPSIS
       ranlib archive ...

DESCRIPTION
       Ranlib converts each archive to a form which can be loaded
       more rapidly by the loader, by adding a table of	 contents
       named  __.SYMDEF to the beginning of the archive.  It uses
       ar(1) to reconstruct the archive, so that sufficient  tem-
       porary  file  space  must  be available in the file system
       containing the current directory.

SEE ALSO
       ld(1), ar(1)

BUGS
       Because generation of a library by ar and randomization by
       ranlib  are  separate,  phase  errors  are  possible.  The
       loader ld warns when the modification date of a library is
       more  recent than the creation of its dictionary; but this
       means you get the  warning  even	 if  you  only	copy  the
       library.
