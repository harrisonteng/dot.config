NAME
       tail - deliver the last part of a file

SYNOPSIS
       tail _number[___] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tail  copies  the named file to the standard output begin-
       ning at a designated place.  If	no  file  is  named,  the
       standard input is used.

       Copying	begins at distance +number from the beginning, or
       -number from the end of the input.  Number is  counted  in
       units  of  lines,  blocks  or characters, according to the
       appended option l, b or c.  When no units  are  specified,
       counting is by lines.

SEE ALSO
       dd(1)

BUGS
       Tails  relative to the end of the file are treasured up in
       a buffer, and thus are limited in length.   Various  kinds
       of  anomalous  behavior	may happen with character special
       files.
