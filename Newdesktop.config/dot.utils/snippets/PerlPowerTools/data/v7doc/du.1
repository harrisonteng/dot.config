NAME
       du  -  summarize disk usage

SYNOPSIS
       du [ -s ] [ -a ] [ name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Du  gives  the number of blocks contained in all files and
       (recursively) directories within each specified	directory
       or file name.  If name is missing, `.'  is used.

       The optional argument -s causes only the grand total to be
       given.  The optional argument -a causes	an  entry  to  be
       generated  for  each  file.   Absence  of either causes an
       entry to be generated for each directory only.

       A file which has two links to it is only counted once.

BUGS
       Non-directories given as arguments (not under  -a  option)
       are not listed.
       If there are too many distinct linked files, du counts the
       excess files multiply.
