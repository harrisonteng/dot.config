NAME
       cp - copy

SYNOPSIS
       cp file1 file2

       cp file ... directory

DESCRIPTION
       File1  is  copied onto file2.  The mode and owner of file2
       are preserved if it  already  existed;  the  mode  of  the
       source file is used otherwise.

       In  the second form, one or more files are copied into the
       directory with their original file-names.

       Cp refuses to copy a file onto itself.
