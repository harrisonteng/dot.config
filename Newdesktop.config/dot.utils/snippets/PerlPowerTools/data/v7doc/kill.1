KILL(1)							  KILL(1)

NAME
       kill - terminate a process with extreme prejudice

SYNOPSIS
       kill [ -signo ] processid ...

DESCRIPTION
       Kill  sends  signal  15	(terminate) to the specified pro-
       cesses.	If a signal number preceded by `-'  is	given  as
       first  argument,	 that signal is sent instead of terminate
       (see signal(2)).	 This will kill	 processes  that  do  not
       catch  the  signal;  in particular `kill -9 ...' is a sure
       kill.

       By convention, if process number 0 is specified, all  mem-
       bers  in	 the process group (i.e. processes resulting from
       the current login) are signaled.

       The killed processes  must  belong  to  the  current  user
       unless  he is the super-user.  To shut the system down and
       bring it up single user the super-user may  use	`kill  -1
       1'; see init(8).

       The process number of an asynchronous process started with
       `&' is reported by the shell.  Process numbers can also be
       found by using ps(1).
