NAME
       tp - manipulate tape archive

SYNOPSIS
       tp [ key ] [ name ... ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tp  saves  and  restores files on DECtape or magtape.  Its
       actions are controlled by the key argument.  The key is	a
       string  of characters containing at most one function let-
       ter and possibly one or more  function  modifiers.   Other
       arguments to the command are file or directory names spec-
       ifying which files are to be dumped, restored, or  listed.
       In all cases, appearance of a directory name refers to the
       files and (recursively) subdirectories of that  directory.

       The function portion of the key is specified by one of the
       following letters:

       r       The named files are written on the tape.	 If files
	       with  the  same	names  already	exist,	they  are
	       replaced.  `Same' is determined by string compari-
	       son,   so   `./abc'  can	 never	be  the	 same  as
	       `/usr/dmr/abc' even if `/usr/dmr' is  the  current
	       directory.   If	no file argument is given, `.' is
	       the default.

       u       updates the tape.  u is like  r,	 but  a	 file  is
	       replaced	 only  if  its modification date is later
	       than the date stored on the tape; that is to  say,
	       if  it  has changed since it was dumped.	 u is the
	       default command if none is given.

       d       deletes the named files from the tape.	At  least
	       one name argument must be given.	 This function is
	       not permitted on magtapes.

       x       extracts the named files from the tape to the file
	       system.	 The  owner and mode are restored.  If no
	       file argument is given, the entire contents of the
	       tape are extracted.

       t       lists  the  names  of  the specified files.  If no
	       file argument is given, the entire contents of the
	       tape is listed.

       The  following  characters  may be used in addition to the
       letter which selects the function desired.

       m	 Specifies magtape as opposed to DECtape.

       0,...,7	 This modifier selects the  drive  on  which  the
		 tape is mounted.  For DECtape, x is default; for
		 magtape `0' is the default.

       v	 Normally tp does its work silently.  The v (ver-
		 bose)	option causes it to type the name of each
		 file it treats preceded by the function  letter.
		 With  the  t  function, v gives more information
		 about the tape entries than just the name.

       c	 means a fresh dump is being  created;	the  tape
		 directory  is	cleared before beginning.  Usable
		 only with r and u.  This option is assumed  with
		 magtape  since	 it  is impossible to selectively
		 overwrite magtape.

       i	 Errors reading and writing the tape  are  noted,
		 but  no action is taken.  Normally, errors cause
		 a return to the command level.

       f	 Use the first named file, rather than a tape, as
		 the  archive.	This option is known to work only
		 with x.

       w	 causes tp to pause before  treating  each  file,
		 type the indicative letter and the file name (as
		 with v) and await the user's response.	 Response
		 y  means  `yes',  so  the file is treated.  Null
		 response means `no', and the file does not  take
		 part  in  whatever  is	 being	done.  Response x
		 means `exit'; the tp command terminates  immedi-
		 ately.	  In  the  x  function,	 files previously
		 asked about have been extracted  already.   With
		 r, u, and d no change has been made to the tape.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Several; the non-obvious one is `Phase error', which means
       the  file  changed  after  it was selected for dumping but
       before it was dumped.

BUGS
       A single file with several links to  it	is  treated  like
       several files.

       Binary-coded  control  information  makes  magnetic  tapes
       written by tp difficult to carry to other machines; tar(1)
       avoids the problem.
