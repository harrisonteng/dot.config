Perl Power Tools: Unix Reconstruction Project

The legacy continues!

Welcome to the Unix Reconstruction Project. Our goal is quite simply  to
reimplement the classic Unix command set in pure Perl, and to have  as
much fun as we can doing so.

For more information please see the website included in this distribution
at html/index.html.

Installation Instructions

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

This will install the PPT binaries in /usr/local/ppt/bin, and their manpages
in /usr/local/ppt/man.

If you would like to change the location that the PPT are installed in,
use the PREFIX argument to Makefile.PL

  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~/ppt
