NAME
       ln  -  make a link

SYNOPSIS
       ln name1 [ name2 ]

DESCRIPTION
       A  link is a directory entry referring to a file; the same
       file (together with its size, all its protection	 informa-
       tion,  etc.)   may  have several links to it.  There is no
       way to distinguish a link to  a	file  from  its	 original
       directory  entry;  any  changes	in the file are effective
       independently of the name by which the file is known.

       Ln creates a link to an existing file name1.  If name2  is
       given,  the  link has that name; otherwise it is placed in
       the current directory and its name is the  last	component
       of name1.

       It  is  forbidden to link to a directory or to link across
       file systems.
