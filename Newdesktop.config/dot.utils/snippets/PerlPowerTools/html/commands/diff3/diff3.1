NAME
       diff3 - 3-way differential file comparison

SYNOPSIS
       diff3 [ -ex3 ] file1 file2 file3

DESCRIPTION
       Diff3  compares	three  versions	 of a file, and publishes
       disagreeing ranges of text flagged with these codes:

       ====	       all three files differ

       ====1	       file1 is different

       ====2	       file2 is different

       ====3	       file3 is different

       The type of change suffered in converting a given range of
       a  given	 file  to some other is indicated in one of these
       ways:

       f : n1 a	       Text is to be appended after  line  number
		       n1 in file f, where f = 1, 2, or 3.

       f : n1 , n2 c   Text is to be changed in the range line n1
		       to line n2.  If n1 = n2, the range may  be
		       abbreviated to n1.

       The  original  contents	of  the range follows immediately
       after a c indication.  When the contents of two files  are
       identical, the contents of the lower-numbered file is sup-
       pressed.

       Under the -e option, diff3 publishes a script for the edi-
       tor  ed	that  will  incorporate	 into  file1  all changes
       between file2 and file3, i.e.  the changes  that	 normally
       would  be flagged ==== and ====3.  Option -x (-3) produces
       a script to incorporate only changes flagged ==== (====3).
       The  following  command will apply the resulting script to
       `file1'.

		(cat script; echo '1,$p') | ed - file1

BUGS
       Text lines that consist of a single `.' will defeat -e.
       Files longer than 64K bytes won't work.
