NAME
       chmod - change mode

SYNOPSIS
       chmod mode file ...

DESCRIPTION
       The  mode of each named file is changed according to mode,
       which may be absolute or symbolic.  An absolute mode is an
       octal  number  constructed  from	 the  OR of the following
       modes:

       4000	 set user ID on execution
       2000	 set group ID on execution
       1000	 sticky bit, see chmod(2)
       0400	 read by owner
       0200	 write by owner
       0100	 execute (search in directory) by owner
       0070	 read, write, execute (search) by group
       0007	 read, write, execute (search) by others

       A symbolic mode has the form:

	      [who] op permission [op permission] ...

       The who part is a combination of the letters u (for user's
       permissions),  g	 (group)  and  o  (other).   The letter a
       stands for ugo.	If who is omitted, the default is  a  but
       the  setting  of	 the file creation mask (see umask(2)) is
       taken into account.

       Op can be + to add permission to the  file's  mode,  -  to
       take away permission and = to assign permission absolutely
       (all other bits will be reset).

       Permission is any combination of the letters r  (read),	w
       (write),	 x  (execute),	s  (set	 owner or group id) and t
       (save text - sticky).  Letters u, g  or	o  indicate  that
       permission is to be taken from the current mode.	 Omitting
       permission is only useful with = to take away all  permis-
       sions.

       The  first  example denies write permission to others, the
       second makes a file executable:

	      chmod o-w file
	      chmod +x file

       Multiple symbolic modes separated by commas may be  given.
       Operations are performed in the order specified.	 The let-
       ter s is only useful with u or g.

       Only the owner of a file (or the	 super-user)  may  change
       its mode.
