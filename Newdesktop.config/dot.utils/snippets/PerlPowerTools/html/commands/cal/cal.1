NAME
       cal - print calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [ month ] year

DESCRIPTION
       Cal  prints a calendar for the specified year.  If a month
       is also specified, a  calendar  just  for  that	month  is
       printed.	  Year can be between 1 and 9999.  The month is a
       number between 1 and 12.	 The calendar  produced	 is  that
       for England and her colonies.

       Try September 1752.

BUGS
       The  year  is  always  considered to start in January even
       though this is historically naive.
       Beware that `cal 78' refers to the  early  Christian  era,
       not the 20th century.
