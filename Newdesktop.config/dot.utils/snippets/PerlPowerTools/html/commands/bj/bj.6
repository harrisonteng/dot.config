NAME
       bj - the game of black jack

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/games/bj

DESCRIPTION
       Bj  is  a  serious attempt at simulating the dealer in the
       game of black jack (or twenty-one) as might  be	found  in
       Reno.  The following rules apply:

       The bet is $2 every hand.

	    A  player  `natural'  (black jack) pays $3.	 A dealer
	    natural loses $2.  Both dealer and player naturals is
	    a `push' (no money exchange).

	    If the dealer has an ace up, the player is allowed to
	    make an `insurance'	 bet  against  the  chance  of	a
	    dealer  natural.   If  this	 bet  is  not taken, play
	    resumes as normal.	If the bet is taken, it is a side
	    bet where the player wins $2 if the dealer has a nat-
	    ural and loses $1 if the dealer does not.

	    If the player is dealt two cards of the  same  value,
	    he is allowed to `double'.	He is allowed to play two
	    hands, each with one of these  cards.   (The  bet  is
	    doubled also; $2 on each hand.)

	    If	a  dealt  hand	has a total of ten or eleven, the
	    player may `double down'.  He may double the bet  ($2
	    to	$4)  and  receive  exactly  one more card on that
	    hand.

	    Under normal play, the player may `hit' (draw a card)
	    as	long as his total is not over twenty-one.  If the
	    player `busts' (goes  over	twenty-one),  the  dealer
	    wins the bet.

	    When  the  player  `stands' (decides not to hit), the
	    dealer hits until he attains a total of seventeen  or
	    more.   If the dealer busts, the player wins the bet.

	    If both player and dealer stand,  the  one	with  the
	    largest total wins.	 A tie is a push.

       The  machine  deals  and keeps score.  The following ques-
       tions will be asked at appropriate times.   Each	 question
       is answered by y followed by a new line for `yes', or just
       new line for `no'.

       ?	 (means, `do you want a hit?')
       Insurance?
       Double down?

       Every time the deck is shuffled, the dealer so states  and
       the  `action'  (total  bet)  and	 `standing' (total won or
       lost) is printed.  To exit, hit the  interrupt  key  (DEL)
       and the action and standing will be printed.
