>DESCRIPTION</a></h1>

<p>Banner prints a large,
high quality banner on the standard output.
If the message is omitted,
it prompts for and reads one line of its standard input.
If <b>-w</b> is given,
the output is scrunched down from a width of 132 to <i>n</i> ,
suit- able for a narrow terminal.</p>

<p>The output should be printed on a hard-copy device,
up to 132 columns wide,
with no breaks between the pages.
The volume is great enough that you may want a printer or a fast hardcopy terminal,
but if you are patient,
a decwriter or other 300 baud terminal will do.</p>

>BUGS</a></h1>

<p>The following bugs are preserved from the implementation on which this one is based:</p>

<ul>
<li>Several ASCII characters are not defined,
notably &#60;, &#62;,
[,
],
\,
^,
_,
{,
},
|,
and ~.
Also,
the characters &#34;,
&#39;,
and &#38; are funny looking (but in a useful way.)</li><p class="pad"></p>

<li>The <b>-w</b> option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.
The smaller it gets,
the grainier the output.
Sometimes it runs letters together.</li><p class="pad"></p>
</ul>

<p>Any new bugs are as yet unknown.</p>
