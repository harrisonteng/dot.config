DESCRIPTION
       Ttt  is the X and O game popular in the first grade.  This
       is a learning program that never makes  the  same  mistake
       twice.

       Although it learns, it learns slowly.  It must lose nearly
       80 games to completely know the game.

       Cubic  plays  three-dimensional	tic-tac-toe  on	 a  4x4x4
       board.  Moves are specified as a sequence of three coordi-
       nate numbers in the range 1-4.
