NAME
       cd - change working directory

SYNOPSIS
       cd directory

DESCRIPTION
       Directory  becomes the new working directory.  The process
       must have execute (search) permission in directory.

       Because a new process is created to execute each	 command,
       cd  would  be  ineffective  if it were written as a normal
       command.	 It is therefore recognized and executed  by  the
       Shell.

SEE ALSO
       sh(1), pwd(1), chdir(2)
