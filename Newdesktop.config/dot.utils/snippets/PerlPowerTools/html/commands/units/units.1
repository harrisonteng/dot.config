NAME
       units - conversion program

SYNOPSIS
       units

DESCRIPTION
       Units  converts	quantities  expressed in various standard
       scales to their equivalents in  other  scales.	It  works
       interactively in this fashion:

	    You have: inch
	    You want: cm
		 * 2.54000e+00
		 / 3.93701e-01

       A quantity is specified as a multiplicative combination of
       units optionally preceded by a numeric multiplier.  Powers
       are  indicated  by suffixed positive integers, division by
       the usual sign:

	    You have: 15 pounds force/in2
	    You want: atm
		 * 1.02069e+00
		 / 9.79730e-01

       Units only does multiplicative scale changes.  Thus it can
       convert	Kelvin	to Rankine, but not Centigrade to Fahren-
       heit.  Most familiar units, abbreviations, and metric pre-
       fixes  are  recognized, together with a generous leavening
       of exotica and a few constants of nature including:

	    pi	 ratio of circumference to diameter
	    c	 speed of light
	    e	 charge on an electron
	    g	 acceleration of gravity
	    force     same as g
	    mole Avogadro's number
	    water     pressure head per unit height of water
	    au	 astronomical unit

       `Pound' is  a  unit  of	mass.	Compound  names	 are  run
       together,  e.g.	`lightyear'.   British	units that differ
       from their US counterparts are prefixed thus:  `brgallon'.
       Currency is denoted `belgiumfranc', `britainpound', ...
