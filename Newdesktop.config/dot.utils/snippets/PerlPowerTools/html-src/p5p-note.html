<p><em>
  tchrist&gt; This is what Ken invented cmp for, guys.  Sheesh.
</em></p>
<p><em>
  bradapp&gt; Surely you aren't referring to the 'cmp' in File::Compare, because<br />
  bradapp&gt; this entire cmpxxxx() functions subthread is precisely about fixing<br />
  bradapp&gt; various portability/configurability problems with the 'cmp' from<br />
  bradapp&gt; that package (sheesh ;-)
</em></p>
<p><em>
  bradapp&gt; Or did you mean some other cmp???
</em></p>
<p>
  You guys are busily bending over backwards and further, just to avoid
  invoking standard, expected, and fundamentally basic tools in an
  altogether laudable effort to enhance portability to even those
  legacy, tool-deficient systems that the underprivileged, unfortunate,
  and sometimes simply unwary masses have been cursed to toil under.
</p>
<p>
  This is good, for their need is great.  Suffering is bad.
</p>
<p>
  But don't stop there!  Don't merely implement a cat module, a cmp
  module, an ls module, a tee module, a basename module, a grep module,
  a head module, a find module, a cp module, an rm module, etc., as you
  are currently doing.  Turn these all into the real programs, and put
  that directory of them in one's path, and you will have given the
  world a small gift of great joy.
</p>

  This modest act, hitherto unaddressed by the mighty Module::Gods,
  would cause tremendous cheers to go up by simple toolsmiths and
  toolaholics everywhere.  It would do a far greater service than mere
  fancy-dancy modules by themselves ever would.  That's because it would
  be real programs usable not just by ultra-elite superprogrammers, but
  by regular humans with simple needs.  It would instantly enhance
  portability of Perl scripts in general and build environments in
  particular, without the beleaguered programmer having to lift a tired
  finger.
</p>
<p>
  In loving memory of RSTS/E, which more than a decade past first showed
  Larry and me how nifty it was to use a high-level language (that would
  be BASIC-PLUS) for systems programming and whence Perl derives some of
  its mindset and even a wee bit of its featureset, let us now therefore
  set forth to create a distribution of small Perl programs comprising
  that most basic and fundamental of toolsets, the one that every loyal
  acolyte of the Interchangeable Way expects to be there but comes up
  empty-handed and despairing.  These old companions would suddenly be
  there as a continual source of comfort for the heretofore lonely
  hacker in his perilous journey deep into the acid heart of the Desert
  of Redmond, and beyond.  A free, purely Perlian /bin-emulation suite
  of tinytools would shine in spiffiness, synergy, security, and of
  course, effect at last that nominally noblest of goals: ubiquitous
  portability.
</p>
<p>
  And it would make nice press for Perl, too, eh?
</p>
<p>
  Modules without programs are slightly silly -- solipsistic
  soliloquies. But cloak these modules in honest tools, and surely shall
  your names be written in the Blessed Book of Courageous Coders who
  helped save the world.
</p>
<p>
  The geas is set.  May the contributions begin.  Happy hacking!
