[% META title = 'Why?' %]

<p>
  Here's why we're doing it:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Laziness</strong>: 
    I'm tired of wasting my life trying to cobble together make-shift
    work-arounds to do the job of fundamental tools that are broken or
    absent on systems various and sundry.  And if it's hard on me,
    imagine the poor guys on systems I must charitably refer to as
    tool-challenged, those lacking even these most fundamental of
    programmer tools.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Impatience</strong>: 
    I get more than a bit impatient when someone has some simple problem
    that can be trivially done using one or three basic commands, but
    when I tell them how to do it, they whinge about not being on a
    proper Unix system and how they therefore can't do the obvious
    thing.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Hubris</strong>: 
    It's listed last, but this is the most important reason -- simply
    being able to say that <em>we did it</em>.  Why do we climb mountains?
    Why do we learn to ski?  Because it's there, and because it's fun!
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Not only can most basic commands be implemented using just a wee bit
  of Perl code, once these have been done, they're automatically much
  more powerful and more robust than the old versions.  No more
  line-too-long errors.  No more fixed-buffer problems.  Any pattern
  matching is automatically turbo-charged.  While we don't expect anyone
  to replace a functioning <tt>/bin</tt> (if they have one), these
  should make good example Perl programs.

  development team announcing the project.
